Rewriting Inject
================

Part 1 of this week's challenge was to reopen the Array class and reimplement the inject method. I rewrote inject using two approaches: using iterators and using recursion. Both rewrites were test-driven with Rspec and compared against the standard inject method. They are able to take starting values and/or method symbols, and the original array is unchangedat the end.
